        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Wagyu is a type of beef steak that is rich in marbling,
            due to the way the cow is treated before harvested.
            Its fat content and distribution are the reason for the
            exquisite taste it is known for. Although these cuts are
            normally imported from Japan, there are American versions
            of the cut as well. However, they are both well above the
            normal price for an average grade of steak.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wagyu cut of choice</li>
            <li>Salt of choice</li>
            <li>Cast iron skillet</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Thaw out wagyu steak to room temperature. The meat should
                be soft when touched
            </li>
            <li>
                Once meat is at room temperature, salt both sides liberally
                with the salt of your choice. Try not to oversalt, find the
                perfect amount. 
            </li>
            <li>
                When finished salting, heat the cooking surface to at least 350 degrees
                Fahrenheit. Once it reaches cooking temperature,
                place steak on surface. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook to desired likeness. Time will vary depending on
                thickness of the cut and heat of the surface. If
                unsure, try to at least get to an internal temperature
                of 145-180 degrees Fahrenheit, with even coloring
                on each side of the steak.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut, serve, enjoy.
            </li>
        </ol>
